## Some Projects I have worked on:

[Linear Algebra Spring Boot Application](https://github.com/noahwenck/LinearAlgebra)  
This project is currently a work in progress, the goal is to create a general-purpose web application that will act as a calculator for process relating to Linear Algebra. Basic matrix operations are functional, and implementing the Row Reduction algorithm is the current goal for the project.

[3-D Illumination and Shading](https://github.com/noahwenck/cg-illumination)  
Using OpenGL fragment and vertex shaders, me and [mattwack](https://github.com/MattWack) implemented Gouraurd and Phong shading on 3-D objects and heightmaps. This was a project for CISC 420 - Computer Graphics. See the finished product [here](https://noahwenck.github.io/cg-illumination/).
