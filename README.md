## Some Projects I have worked on:

[Linear Algebra Spring Boot Application](https://github.com/noahwenck/LinearAlgebra)</br>
This project is currently a work in progress, the goal is to create a general-purpose web application that will act as a calculator for process relating to Linear Algebra. This is based of an older personal project that had the same function, but was console based. For how little it implemented, that console-based calculator may have been one of the main reasons I got hired at VUE.
</br>Basic matrix operations are functional, and implementing the Row Reduction algorithm is the current goal for the project.

[3-D Illumination and Shading](https://github.com/noahwenck/cg-illumination)</br>
Using OpenGL fragment and vertex shaders, me and [mattwack](https://github.com/MattWack) implemented Gouraurd and Phong shading on 3-D objects and heightmaps. This was a project for CISC 420 - Computer Graphics. See the finished product [here](https://noahwenck.github.io/cg-illumination/).
</br></br>
[Line Drawing and Triangle Filling](https://github.com/noahwenck/cg-shapescurves2)</br>
This was the first assignment for CISC 420. While one of the simpler assignments, I super enjoyed this one because of the Bezier Curve. In high school, I was very bad at math. At UST, I found a new love for math (as evident by my attempt to make a Spring Boot application for Linear Algebra). The Bezier Curve is fascinating to me, and while working on this assignment, I spent the majority of my time learning about Bezier Curves, and I hope to work with them again at some point.
